This program checks whether a given graph is bipartite or not. This is an implementation of a distributed algorithm.

Implementation tools: Python and MPI


Input: Given an undirected graph G.
Output: check whether the graph is bipartite or not. If the graph is not bipartite then it returns why this graph is not bipartite. It also shows the running time of the program for different number of machines. 

Running command:
mpiexec -n <# machines> python bipartite.py
